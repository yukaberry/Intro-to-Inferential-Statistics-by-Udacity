# Project : Intro to Inferential Statistics by Udacity
**About this project and course's objective** : [This course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201) focuses on enhancing your ability to develop hypotheses and use common tests such as t-tests, ANOVA tests, and regression to validate your claims.<br/>
You can answer practice problems and quizzes to test your abilities. In free courses, model answers are not provided by Udacity. I include all of answers of quizes and problemsets. I hope this will help with students who are learning python and inferential statistics.
